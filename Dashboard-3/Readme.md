# HMIS Public Health Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end public health analytics solution built using the **Health Management Information System (HMIS)** dataset.

The dashboard focuses on **maternal & child health**, **disease burden**, and **healthcare service utilization** to identify gaps in access, infrastructure dependency, and seasonal trends across selected Indian states.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze maternal and child health indicators such as ANC coverage, institutional deliveries, anaemia, and immunization.
- Study disease burden and seasonal trends across major communicable diseases.
- Compare healthcare utilization across **public vs private** and **rural vs urban** facilities.
- Enable state-wise and time-based insights for data-driven decision-making.
